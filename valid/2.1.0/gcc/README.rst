of GCC's test suite.

Notes
*****

* 3.11.5-escaped-braces.sarif:

  Hand-written example of SARIF containing escaped ``{`` and ``}`` within
  the ``text`` of a ``message``.

* 3.11.6-embedded-links.sarif:

  Hand-written examples of message ``text``, some with embedded links.
  Example 2 is without the fix from
  https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/656,
  whereas example 3 has the fix.

* 3.27.30-fixes-{1,2,3}.sarif:

  Examples of GCC 15 SARIF output for fix-it hints (replacement,
  deletion, and insertion, respectively), simplified somewhat by hand.

* 3.28.6-annotations-1.sarif:

  Example of GCC 15 SARIF output from the C compiler for bad types passed to
  infix binary ``+``, where ``annotations`` are used to highlight the types
  of the operands.  Simplified somewhat by hand.

* error-with-note.sarif:

  Hand-written example of GCC SARIF output for an ``error`` followed by a
  ``note``, with the latter represented via an element of ``relatedLocations``
  with a ``message``.
