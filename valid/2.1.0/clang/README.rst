Examples of .sarif files generated by clang.
of GCC's test suite.

Notes
*****

* missing-semicolon.c.sarif

  Example SARIF output copied from Compiler Explorer's output window
  when using x86-64 clang 19.1.0 and ``-fdiagnostics-format=sarif``
  on this input::

    #include <stdlib.h>

    void foo (void *p)
    {
      free (p)
    }

  Original output was all on one line; this was manually reformatted
  using ``python -m json.tool``

  Doesn't seem to have fix-it hint (filed as https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/127813)
